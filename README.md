 Musical Instrument Recognition in Monophonic Music.
=======================================================
The music-instrument-classification system identify the musical instrument which you play.
This was initially built as an University Project.

 The project was conducted in two phases,

 1)Phase 1: Conducted using machine learning(based on SVM approach) but, due to  the limations of the time and the scope of the project decided to do the project 
   with Arduino based platform.  
 2)Phase 2: Conducted with Arduino based platform.This instrument recognition system has the ability to recognize both piccolo and the bass drum.

 1)Phase 1:
 *Created an own dataset composed with 500 instances of each instrument(for the training purpose) and pre-processed by using several techniques with python 
  built-in libraries. 
 *Conducted and completed upto the testing phase by applying SVM approach.
 *Classifies instruments such, piano, flute, tabla, guitar and violin.
 *The testing and other stages weren't conducted due to the limations of the time and the scope of the project.
 

 2)Phase 2:
 *Set up the apparatus as described in the vedio, compile and upload the sketch into the UNO board.
 *So, the LCD screen will display the message "Music World!".
 *Next,play an audio file by bringing it near to the microphone.
 *Finally, the system displays the instrument that has been used in the audio recording (either piccolo or bass drum) on the LCD screen and you can repeat this 
  process again and again by using the reset botton.
